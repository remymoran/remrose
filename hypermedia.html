<h1>Project 2: Hypermedia & Mirrors</h1>

 <p>For my second project I made an interactive website using p5.js and Photoshop. I started this project by looking for food that was smiling because I thought it was cute. I had been watching a lot of House of Dragon, and felt inspired to add dragons to my collage as well. In my art I like to use a variety of mediums that donâ€™t seem like they would work well together. So, I made the background of my collage and the dragons look realistic to contrast the animated smiling food. My first interaction for this project is an image of a smiling burnt piece of  toast that acts as a button. When viewers click on the toast it is randomly relocated somewhere else in the collage. I added a picture of flames at the bottom of the screen where the toast is originally placed to make it seem as though it was burnt from the dragons. The second interaction is an animated pancake that moves across the top of the screen. Finally, my last interaction in the collage is a boba drink flying on a dragon that follows the computer mouse. I think that the use of different mediums keeps this project lighthearted and enjoyable. I like to use arbitrary themes in my work and I think that this piece really plays into that.</p>
