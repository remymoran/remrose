  For Project 3 I used a circuit board to create a bracelet that can detect your mood, like a mood ring. I coded the circuit board so 
  that it would detect temperature in degrees fahrenheit and change color based on what temperature it was. When making my mood-reading 
  circuit board, I realized that because the circuit board is metal, it would make the temper hotter than normal body temperatures. To 
  combat this, I altered the temperatures for what the different moods are. The circuit board flashes blue if the wearer is at a relaxed, 
  blue/green when emotions are slightly charged, dark green is an average reading with no stress, while yellow is nervous or unsettled. 
  Additionally, the board will flash purple when in a happy or passionate mood. I made my circuit board so it could be worn on the wrist, 
  like a bracelet, or around your neck, like a necklace. This circuit board is a new take on mood rings, and even enhances them because the 
  exact temperature of the circuit board appears in Mu Editor when the circuit board is worn.
