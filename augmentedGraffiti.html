 <p>For Project 1 I decided to augment the Herman B Wells statue. I chose this statue because Wells is held in such high regard. 
   During his presidency he promoted academic freedom, supported Alfred Kinseyâ€™s research on sex, and fought racial discrimination 
   on campus and in college sports. His statue, located in the Old Crescent area of campus, was made to celebrate his life and 
   legacy shortly after he passed away. Legend has it that shaking the hand of the Herman B Wells statue grants good luck, and it 
   is tradition at Indiana University for students to shake his hand before exams and for first year students to shake it when visiting 
   for orientation. Since it is a tradition for students to shake the hand of the statue I decided to augment the statue to make obstacles 
   so it would be difficult for students to reach his hand. In Unity, I made a model of a sword, which I placed in his  outstretched hand, 
   and fire, which I placed around his shoulders. Additionally, I made an endless hole in front of the statue where students would stand to 
   shake his hand. By augmenting the Herman B Wells statue, this project transforms a tradition for students into an obstacle.
