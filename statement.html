<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

 <p>
 As an artist, I am interested in making digital art that is interactive with an arbitrary sense to it. I think that art is enjoyable when 
   the audience can participate and it can influence how viewers understand and interpret art. I love to make artwork that uses low poly models 
   or has a psychedelic or arbitrary aesthetic, by using different mediums and a lot of bright colors. Going forward,  I aspire to continue to 
   make low-poly models in Unity and Maya. I love low poly art because it is unique and allows for the use of different, bright colors. Majoring 
   in Media Advertising with a specialization in creative advertising has inspired me to pursue a job as a graphic designer in marketing or use my 
   art to make advertisements post-graduation. I knew that I wanted to change my minor from Marketing to Creative Technologies in Art and Design after 
   taking a class where I made different advertisements for made-up products and used software like Photoshop for other projects. Because my major is 
   Media Advertising I am usually more focused on the business side of making advertisements and marketing them, since that is what most of my major 
   classes consist of. For some of my past projects, I took inspiration from Liam Brazier, an artist who makes a lot of low poly art. I find his art 
   very impressive and I like how colorful it is because I also like to work with many bright colors. Another artist that I found in my research is 
   Breno Bitencourt. I like his low poly art and he also works with companies to create logos and advertisements, which is similar to what I would be 
   interested in doing after graduation. Using art in advertisements is so important because art in advertisements can appeal to target audiences and 
   influence them to purchase products. Art also influences how significant advertisements are. My digital art style would be beneficial in creating 
   logos and advertising because it is a growing medium. Using low poly art in advertisements is not very common, and therefore could be very memorable 
   to target audiences.
