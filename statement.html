<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

 <p>
 As an artist, I am interested in making digital art that is interactive with an arbitrary sense to it. 
   I love to make artwork that uses low poly models or has a psychedelic or arbitrary theme to it, which 
   is why almost all of the art that I make is somewhat random and non-realistic. I aspire to continue to 
   make low-poly models in Unity and Maya. I really enjoy digital art and prefer to work with these mediums. 
   Majoring in Media Advertising with a specialization in creative advertising, has inspired me to pursue a 
   job as a graphic designer in marketing or use my art to make advertisements post-graduation. I knew that 
   I wanted to change my minor from Marketing to Creative Technologies in Art and Design after taking a class 
   where we made different advertisements for made-up products and we used software like Photoshop for other projects. 
   I think that because my major is Media Advertising I am usually more focused on the business side of making advertisements 
   and marketing them because that is what most of my major classes consist of. For some of my past projects, I took inspiration 
   from Liam Brazier, an artist who makes a lot of low poly art. I find his art very impressive and I like how colorful it is 
   because I also like to work with a lot of bright colors. Another artist that I found in my research is Breno Bitencourt. 
   I like his low poly art and he also works with companies to create logos and advertisements, which is similar to what I would 
   be interested in doing after graduation.
