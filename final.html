  For the final project, I decided to revisit p5.js and make a collage of things that I love about Indiana University. Going into my final 
  semester here at IU, I was feeling sentimental when making this final project. I started this project by making a background picture of the 
  sample gates. I originally wanted the background of my collage to be an image of the sample gates over a picture of Chicago because I am moving 
  there after graduation. However, once I made that background in Photoshop I felt like it looked cluttered and had too much going on. Instead, 
  I decided to make the background a picture of the sample gates, which I cut and edited to make it look angled, over a picture of outer space. 
  Then, I started adding cutouts of things that I love about IU. I added a bike for Little 500, a red clock, Memorial Stadium, the chair Bobby 
  Knight threw, red and white tulips, and the Kilroys sign. I animated the bike to move across the top of the screen and the clock to be a button 
  that is randomly moved after clicking. I also animated the chair to act like a spring so it can be thrown and then bounce around. After working 
  in p5.js for a second time, I am more confident in my coding skills, however, I am going to continue practicing and improving.
